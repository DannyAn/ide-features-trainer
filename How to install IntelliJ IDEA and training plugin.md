# How to install IntelliJ IDEA and training plugin

**1. Install IntelliJ IDEA 15 to your computer.** If you are in doubt how to do it please refer to the [installation instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/installing-and-launching.html). If any installation steps are unclear please mention them in the [survey](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2471422/bb8318c8c870) after the module.
[Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) IntelliJ IDEA. It’s up to you what edition to use, Community or Ultimate, they will both work for you.

**2. Install training plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.**  Download [the plugin](https://github.com/karashevich/training/raw/master/training.zip). Start IntelliJ IDEA and open Preferences menu (use **Ctrl + Alt + S** on Win or Linux, and **⌘,** on Mac). Type “plugins", than press button “Install plugin from disk…” and specify a path to “training.zip” (it must already be in your Downloads directory). Restart IntelliJ IDEA.

**3. Start learning with the plugin.** Create a new Java project (non-empty) or open existing project with configured JDK. As soon as IntelliJ IDEA starts, a new menu item “**Learn**” will appear between “Window" and “Help”. Begin with any exercise to learn IntelliJ IDEA actions and shortcuts. 

**4. Give us a feedback.** We kindly ask you to [answer few questions](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2471422/bb8318c8c870) after you completed all exercises. Your [feedback](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2471422/bb8318c8c870) is really important for us.
