# How to install IntelliJ IDEA with training plugin

**1. Install IntelliJ IDEA 15 to your computer.**
	It is not difficult (especially if it is already installed). We are doing it quite often so maybe some steps are not clear to the first time — please remember these steps and write us in a feedback. IntelliJ IDEA could be downloaded [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). We suggest you to install Community Edition because it is lighter, but Ultimate Edition is always work with the plugin and is absolutely free for you (ask your JetBrains ambassador if you still haven’t heard about it). 

**2. Install training-plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.**
	Go to GitHub repository of the plugin and download a zip archive via this [link](https://github.com/karashevich/training/raw/master/training.zip). Start IntelliJ IDEA and open Preferences menu (use **Ctrl + Alt + S** for Win and Linux or **⌘,** for mac). Type “plugins", than press button “Install plugin from disk…”  and specify a path to “training.zip”. Restart IntelliJ IDEA...

**3. Use the plugin**
	After restarting of IntelliJ IDEA a new menu “Learn” will appear between “Window" and “Help” menus. Start from any lesson to learn IntelliJ IDEA shortcuts. 

**4. Feedback**
	We kindly ask you to leave a feedback. It is really important for us.
