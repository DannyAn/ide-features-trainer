GENERATE COURSES
To generate specific course you have to:
 # create a directory with a Course name (or it maybe shortname of course)
 # run training.util.GenerateCourseXml.gen(String courseName, String id, String path)
 # copy result to res/data/

Example Completions:
    courseName: "Completions"
    id: "completions"
    path: "Completions/"

To generate all courses:
 # run training.util.GenerateCourseXml.main()
 # exclude redundant files from courses.xml list
